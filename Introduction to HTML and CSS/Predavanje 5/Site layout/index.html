		<p class="transp">The details of this question compare an as yet unreleased Apple chip with an almost 5 year old AMD chip which might lead you to believe that smart phone processors are lagging about 5 years behind PC processors except you really wouldn’t have enough pieces of the puzzle to make that statement.</p>
		
		<p class="transp">Repair:Repairing a desktop computer is much easier since most of the hardware can be easily purchased off the shelf of any local computer retail store.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Gaming:Desktops are capable of using high-powered video cards that have higher power requirements and require better heat reduction/dissipation. Due to the space in a desktop and the capability of using 1000+ Watt power supplies, virtually any video card could be used in a desktop, including two or more video cards at the same time.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Cost:There is a wide variety of component options available for desktops, allowing for a large range of prices, but the starting point is relatively cheap. Desktops can start as low as $400 for a full package (computer & monitor) and still be a pretty powerful system.</strong></p>
		<p id="imp">No, smartphone CPUs haven’t gotten to a point where they offer comparable performance to PC processors in terms of pure compute performance.</p>

		<p>Processor:Desktop processors are a little bit larger in size, but this also means the desktop processors can be more powerful than laptop processors. New, advanced processors on the market are typically available in desktop computers first.</p>
		<p><strong>Keyboard:Desktops can make use of full size keyboards, including a number pad. There are really no limitations.
		Screen size	Desktop monitors can be 15" or larger. It is even possible to hook up a desktop to a TV, so screen sizes could be as large as a TV. This provides for great flexibility on what the desktop is used for and in what environment.</strong></p>
		<p><strong>Upgrading:Most components in a desktop are easily removable, making it easier to upgrade and since desktop cases are usually much bigger they're easier to work in when doing any upgrading.</strong></p>
